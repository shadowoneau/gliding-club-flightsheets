These are the sources for GGC_Flightsheets.

Notes:

1) This is intended to be built with the Microsoft's free Visual Studio Express 2012
   Download: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products

2) FileHelpers is a pretty big package just for reading .csv files. On
   the other hand, it works well. I did modify the source slightly:

    diff -r  Original/FileHelpers_Source/FileHelpers/Converters/ConvertHelpers.cs \
    	       ../GGC_FlightSheet/FileHelpers_source/Converters/ConvertHelpers.cs
    398c398,401
    <                               return Convert.ToDateTime(from).ToString(mFormat);
    ---
    >                 if (from == null)
    >                     return "";
    >                 else
    >                                   return Convert.ToDateTime(from).ToString(mFormat);

3) I use the NSIS installer builder with the XML plugin.
